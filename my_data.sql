By securing your hair underneath a silicone or latex cap, you can more easily glide through the water, increasing your speed and allowing you to propel through the water faster than ever. Of course, your hard work and training is what will dramatically increase your speed, but the seconds saved with a swimming head cap are invaluable when it comes to race day, and those few seconds are all that will set you apart from the competition. This slick Nike latex swim cap comes in one size but a plethora of colors like red, black, yellow, purple, and many more.   To care for your Nike latex swim cap, keep the following in mind:    It should only be rinsed in cold water. Wipe dry inside and out after every use.   Never leave your swimming head cap in direct sunlight.  The sun will dry out the latex, causing cracks and splits  Lightly sprinkle with talcum powder to keep in great condition  Avoid contact with sharp objects like jewelry, fingernails, zippers, etc. that could cause it to tear  Want more information about Nike?
