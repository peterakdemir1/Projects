							<p>don't be scared to wear these - the compression works well, they fit well and seem hard wearing - white you need to wash and add a little bleach or chlorine makes them go a little yellowish</p>

							<p>I have been buying these trunks and wearing these trunks almost exclusively for years. I find the quality and fit perfect. The back and front center seam allows this suit to fit like a glove.  I especially like how Speedo continues to offer a range of colors. In the past the selections have been boring. Now and then Speedo offers the same cut but in different patterns, not just solids. I wish they would make more of these types, even revisiting the retro looks like color side panels as in my high school days swim meets. Another negative though. Sometimes they use a black material to provide a sense of modesty in the front, but when they are wet the dark color shows through. Very unflattering. If they want to provide modesty in this suit then double layer the same color of fabric. They should not be worrying about someone being modest in this suit. It's cut short, and brief and looks down right sexy.  If you are shy about wearing a bikini in public, this suit is not for you. But if you enjoy the total freedom while wearing this suit, along with the smiles they bring,  I say buy several and enjoy the freedom!</p>

This was a product that I really wanted because of the color choice.  The fit was somewhat less than what I come to expect from this product.  There was a little too much fabric in the rear which didn't give it the nice tight fit I normally get.  Otherwise, I liked the product very much.</p>
